# lights-yes

This is a project about mathematical analysis and solution search for the game originally called "Ligths Out". 
It has the Jupyter Notebook that implements the linear algebra approach to solving this game. 
More about this approach can be found out in [this paper](https://dc.ewu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1166&context=theses). 
There exists another, shorter [paper](http://buzzard.ups.edu/courses/2007spring/projects/olson-paper-revised.pdf) that I used as a reference.
